# DPO Module Documentation

## 1. Module Overview
- **Module Name:** DPO (Divergence-based Policy Optimization)
- **Purpose:**  
  The DPO module implements the Divergence-based Policy Optimization algorithm for optimizing policy models based on divergence metrics. It leverages a policy model and a reference model to compute divergence, which is then used to optimize the policy model parameters.
- **Key Responsibilities:**
  - Optimize policy models using divergence metrics.
  - Compute divergence between policy and reference models.
  - Provide a seamless interface for integrating with Transformer-based models.

## 2. Detailed Responsibilities
- **Policy Optimization:**  
  Utilizes divergence metrics to adjust and improve the policy model's parameters, ensuring better performance and adherence to desired behaviors.
  
- **Divergence Computation:**  
  Calculates the divergence between the policy model and a frozen reference model to guide the optimization process.
  
- **Integration with Transformer Models:**  
  Designed to work with `TransformerWrapper` models, facilitating easy integration and usage within Transformer-based architectures.

## 3. Components

### Classes

#### `DPO`
The main class implementing the Divergence-based Policy Optimization algorithm.

- **Attributes:**
  - `policy_model (TransformerWrapper)`: The policy model to be optimized.
  - `ref_model (TransformerWrapper)`: A frozen reference model used for computing divergence.
  - `beta (float)`: Parameter controlling the influence of divergence in the optimization.
  - `pad_id (int, optional)`: ID used for padding tokens.

- **Methods:**
  - `__init__(self, model: TransformerWrapper, *, beta: float = 0.1, pad_id: int = None)`: Initializes the DPO model.
  - `parameters(self) -> Iterator[torch.nn.Parameter]`: Returns an iterator over the model parameters.
  - `forward(self, preferred_seq: torch.Tensor, unpreferred_seq: torch.Tensor, *, prompt_mask: torch.Tensor, preferred_seq_mask: torch.Tensor = None, unpreferred_seq_mask: torch.Tensor = None) -> torch.Tensor`: Computes the DPO loss.

#### Helper Functions

- **`exists(v)`**  
  Checks if a variable is not `None`.

- **`freeze_all_layers_(module)`**  
  Freezes all layers in a given module to prevent them from being updated during training.

- **`log_prob_from_model_and_seq(model, seq)`**  
  Computes the log probabilities of a sequence given a model.

- **`masked_mean(log_probs, mask=None)`**  
  Computes the mean of log probabilities, optionally applying a mask.

- **`maybe_and_mask(*masks)`**  
  Combines multiple masks using logical AND, returning `None` if no masks are provided.

### Example Usage
```python
from x_transformers.x_transformers import TransformerWrapper
from open_strawberry_torch.dpo import DPO
Initialize your Transformer model
transformer = TransformerWrapper(...)
Initialize the DPO model with the Transformer
dpo_model = DPO(model=transformer, beta=0.1, pad_id=0)
Prepare your data
preferred_seq = torch.tensor([...])
unpreferred_seq = torch.tensor([...])
prompt_mask = torch.tensor([...])
Compute the DPO loss
loss = dpo_model(preferred_seq, unpreferred_seq, prompt_mask=prompt_mask)
```

## 4. Data Model
Not applicable for the DPO module as it primarily focuses on model optimization without managing specific data entities.

## 5. API Specifications
