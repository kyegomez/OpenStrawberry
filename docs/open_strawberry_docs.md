## 2. Overview
Open Strawberry is a transformer-based reinforcement learning framework designed to simulate and optimize decision-making processes using Monte Carlo Tree Search and Divergence-based Policy Optimization (DPO). It integrates various neural network models to generate, evaluate, and refine action sequences within a defined state space.

**Purpose:**  
The framework aims to provide a robust environment for training policy and value networks, enabling sophisticated strategies in complex, sequential decision-making tasks.

**Context:**  
Open Strawberry operates within a graph-based codebase management system, leveraging graph databases to manage state transitions and action evaluations effectively.

**Key Concepts and Terminology:**
- **Policy Network:** Neural network that outputs action probabilities based on input states.
- **Value Network:** Estimates the value of a given state sequence.
- **Reward Model:** Assigns reward values to state-action sequences.
- **Monte Carlo Rollout:** Simulation method to predict future states and rewards.
- **DPO (Divergence-based Policy Optimization):** Optimization technique focused on minimizing divergence between policy and reference models.

|-------------------|------|---------|------------------------------------|
| `input_dim`       | int  | N/A     | Dimension of the input state       |
| `action_dim`      | int  | N/A     | Number of possible actions         |
| `nhead`           | int  | 8       | Number of attention heads          |
| `num_layers`      | int  | 6       | Number of transformer layers       |
| `dim_feedforward` | int  | 2048    | Dimension of feedforward layers    |
| `dropout`         | float| 0.1     | Dropout rate                       |

**Functionality:**  
Processes input state sequences through embedding layers and transformer encoders to produce action probabilities.

**Usage Example:**
```python
policy_net = TransformerPolicyNetwork(input_dim=10, action_dim=4).to(device)
action_probs = policy_net(state_sequence)
```

### TransformerValueNetwork (`open_strawberry_torch/model.py`)
A transformer-based value network that estimates the value of a given state sequence.

**Parameters:**  
Same as `TransformerPolicyNetwork` excluding `action_dim`.

**Functionality:**  
Processes input state sequences to estimate their corresponding values.

**Usage Example:**
```python
value_net = TransformerValueNetwork(input_dim=10).to(device)
state_value = value_net(state_sequence)
```

### TransformerRewardModel (`open_strawberry_torch/model.py`)
A transformer-based reward model that assigns rewards to state sequences.

**Parameters:**  
Same as `TransformerValueNetwork`.

**Functionality:**  
Evaluates state sequences and assigns reward values based on predefined criteria.

**Usage Example:**
```python
reward_model = TransformerRewardModel(input_dim=10).to(device)
reward = reward_model(state_sequence)
```

### ThoughtTree (`open_strawberry_torch/model.py`)
Manages a tree of thought sequences, allowing for the addition of child nodes representing possible future states.

**Methods:**
- `add_child(parent, child_state, reward)`: Adds a child node to the specified parent node.

**Usage Example:**
```python
thought_tree = ThoughtTree(root_state)
child = thought_tree.add_child(parent_node, new_state, reward)
```


### Monte Carlo Rollout (`open_strawberry_torch/model.py`)
Simulates future state sequences to predict rewards and guide policy optimization.

**Functionality:**  
Performs rollouts from the current state to a specified depth, generating trajectories of states and associated rewards.

**Usage Example:**
```python
trajectory = monte_carlo_rollout(policy_net, state_sequence, depth, max_depth, sequence_length)
```


### DPO Module (`open_strawberry_torch/dpo.py`)
Implements Divergence-based Policy Optimization to refine the Policy Network by minimizing divergence from a reference model.

**Parameters:**
| Name        | Type | Default | Description                        |
|-------------|------|---------|------------------------------------|
| `model`     | TransformerWrapper | N/A | The policy model to optimize       |
| `beta`      | float | 0.1     | Divergence metric parameter        |
| `pad_id`    | int   | None    | Padding token ID                   |

**Functionality:**  
Calculates the DPO loss based on the divergence between the policy and reference models and updates the policy accordingly.

**Usage Example:**
```python
dpo = DPO(model=policy_model, beta=0.1, pad_id=tokenizer.pad_id)
loss = dpo(preferred_seq, unpreferred_seq, prompt_mask)
```

## 5. Integration with Graph Database
**Interaction:**  
The module interacts with the graph structure by representing state sequences as nodes and actions as edges. This facilitates efficient querying and manipulation of the state-action space.

**Node and Edge Types:**
- **Nodes:** Represent state sequences.
- **Edges:** Represent actions leading from one state to another.

**Graph Operations:**  
- **Querying:** Fetch specific state sequences and their related actions.
- **Modification:** Update node states or add/remove edges based on simulation outcomes.

## 6. LLM Agent Interaction
**Description:**  
LLM agents utilize the framework to generate and evaluate action sequences. They can initiate rollouts and influence the optimization process through feedback mechanisms.

**Examples of Agent-Initiated Operations:**
- Initiating a Monte Carlo rollout from a specific state.
- Providing feedback to adjust reward assignments.
