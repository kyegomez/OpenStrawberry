# Reward Function Documentation

## 1. Module Overview
- **Component Name:** Reward Function
- **Purpose:** Calculates the reward associated with a given state, guiding the learning process of the policy network.
- **Key Responsibilities:**
  - Defining the criteria for rewarding specific states.
  - Providing scalar reward values based on state evaluations.
  
## 2. Detailed Responsibilities
- **Reward Calculation:** Implements logic to compute rewards from state tensors.
- **Guidance:** Directs the policy network towards desirable states through reward signals.

## 3. Components
- **Functions:**
  - `reward_function`: Computes the reward for a given state tensor.
  
## 4. Data Model
- **Input Parameters:**
  - `state` (torch.Tensor): The state tensor for which the reward is to be calculated.
- **Output:**
  - `reward` (float): The calculated reward value.

## 5. API Specifications
Not applicable for this component.

## 6. Implementation Details
- **Technology Stack:** Implemented in Python using PyTorch for tensor operations.
- **Architectural Patterns:** Stateless function performing deterministic or stochastic reward calculations.
- **Integration Points:** Utilized within the `monte_carlo_rollout` and training functions to assign rewards to states.

## 7. Security Considerations
- **Data Validation:** Ensures that input states are valid and properly formatted before reward computation.

## 8. Performance & Scalability
- **Optimization:** Designed for rapid computation of rewards to not bottleneck the training process.
- **Scalability:** Capable of handling multiple reward calculations concurrently if needed.

## 9. Extensibility
- **Future Enhancements:** Ability to incorporate more complex reward structures or dynamically adjust rewards based on training progress.

## 10. Example Use Cases
```python
Define a sample state tensor
state = torch.tensor([1.0, -2.0, 3.0])
Calculate the reward for the state
reward = reward_function(state)
print(reward) # Output: -14.0
```

## 11. Testing Strategies
- **Unit Tests:** Verify the correctness of reward calculations for various input states.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure that rewards are correctly applied within the training and rollout processes.

## 12. Deployment Instructions
- **Dependencies:** Requires PyTorch for tensor operations.
- **Usage:** Invoked within simulation and training loops to assign rewards to states.

## 13. Visual Aids
- **Flowchart:** Illustrates the process of receiving a state and outputting a reward.

## 14. Inter-Module Documentation
- **Dependencies:** Depends on valid state tensors from other modules such as the policy network and transition function.
- **Interactions:** Provides reward values used by the training loop to update the policy and value networks.

## 15. Glossary
- **Reward Signal:** A numerical value that indicates the desirability of a particular state, guiding the learning agent's behavior.

## 16. Version Control and Update Logs
- **Version 1.0:** Initial implementation and documentation.

## 17. Accessibility and Internationalization
- **Accessibility:** Documentation is clear and follows readability best practices.
- **Internationalization:** Available in English with potential for translation.

## 18. Search Optimization
