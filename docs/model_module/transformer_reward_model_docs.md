# TransformerRewardModel Documentation

## 1. Module Overview
- **Component Name:** TransformerRewardModel
- **Purpose:** Assigns rewards to thought branches using a transformer-based architecture.
- **Key Responsibilities:**
  - Embedding thought branch state sequences.
  - Encoding sequences with transformer layers.
  - Outputting reward estimates for each thought branch.

## 2. Detailed Responsibilities
- **Embedding:** Transforms input state dimensions to a higher-dimensional space suitable for transformer processing.
- **Transformer Encoding:** Processes embedded sequences to capture dependencies and patterns within thought branches.
- **Reward Output:** Applies a linear layer to generate scalar reward estimates for each thought branch.

## 3. Components
- **Classes:**
  - `TransformerRewardModel`: Defines the network architecture and forward computation.
- **Methods:**
  - `__init__`: Initializes the network layers and parameters.
  - `forward`: Performs the forward pass to compute reward estimates.

## 4. Data Model
Not applicable for this component.

## 5. API Specifications
Not applicable for this component.

## 6. Implementation Details
- **Technology Stack:** Utilizes PyTorch's `nn.Module` for implementation.
- **Architectural Patterns:** Employs transformer encoder layers for effective sequence modeling.
- **Integration Points:** Receives thought branch state sequences and provides reward estimates to the training process.

## 7. Security Considerations
- **Data Handling:** Ensures that input sequences are validated and sanitized before processing.

## 8. Performance & Scalability
- **Optimization:** Utilizes optimized transformer layers for efficient computation.
- **Scalability:** Can handle various sequence lengths and batch sizes as dictated by training requirements.

## 9. Extensibility
- **Future Enhancements:** Capability to incorporate different transformer configurations or additional layers for improved reward estimation.

## 10. Example Use Cases
```python
Initialize the reward model
reward_model = TransformerRewardModel(input_dim=10)
Forward pass with a sample input
thought_sequence = torch.randn(10, 1, 10) # (sequence_length, batch_size, input_dim)
reward_estimate = reward_model(thought_sequence)
print(reward_estimate)
---
python
Initialize the thought tree with a root state
root_state = torch.zeros(10) # Example state tensor
thought_tree = ThoughtTree(root_state)
Add a child to the root node
child_state = torch.ones(10) # Example child state tensor
reward = 5.0 # Example reward
child_node = thought_tree.add_child(thought_tree.root, child_state, reward)
print(thought_tree.root)
print(child_node)
---
python
Define sample inputs
policy_net = TransformerPolicyNetwork(input_dim=10, action_dim=4)
state_sequence = torch.zeros(10, 1, 10) # Initial state sequence
depth = 0
max_depth = 5
sequence_length = 10
Perform Monte Carlo rollout
trajectory = monte_carlo_rollout(
policy_net=policy_net,
state_sequence=state_sequence,
depth=depth,
max_depth=max_depth,
sequence_length=sequence_length
)
for seq, reward in trajectory:
print(f"Sequence: {seq}, Reward: {reward}")
---
python
Define current state and action
current_state = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
action = torch.tensor([0.5, -0.2, 0.1])
Perform state transition
next_state = transition(current_state, action)
print(next_state)
---
python
Define a sample state tensor
state = torch.tensor([1.0, -2.0, 3.0])
Calculate the reward for the state
reward = reward_function(state)
print(reward) # Output: -14.0
