## 1. Module Overview
- **Module Name:** Model Module
- **Purpose:** The Model Module provides the necessary neural network architectures and training functions for reinforcement learning within the GBCMS framework. It includes transformer-based policy, value, and reward networks, along with functions to manage thought trees and perform Monte Carlo rollouts.
- **Key Responsibilities:**
  - Define transformer-based networks for policy, value, and reward prediction.
  - Manage thought trees representing the agent's possible future states.
  - Implement training routines using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

## 2. Detailed Responsibilities
- **Network Definitions:**
  - `TransformerPolicyNetwork`: Outputs action probabilities given a state sequence.
  - `TransformerValueNetwork`: Estimates the value of a given state sequence.
  - `TransformerRewardModel`: Assigns rewards to thought branches.
- **Thought Management:**
  - `ThoughtTree` class manages the hierarchical structure of possible future states and their associated rewards.
- **Simulation:**
  - `monte_carlo_rollout`: Simulates future thoughts to evaluate potential actions.
- **Training:**
  - `train`: Trains the policy and value networks using the PPO algorithm.

## 3. Components

- **Description:** A transformer-based policy network that outputs probabilities over possible actions given a sequence of states.
- **Classes and Methods:**
  - `__init__(...)`: Initializes the network layers.
  - `forward(src)`: Performs the forward pass to compute action probabilities.
- **Example Usage:**
    ```python
    policy_net = TransformerPolicyNetwork(input_dim=10, action_dim=4)
    action_probs = policy_net(state_sequence)
    ```

### 3.2 TransformerValueNetwork
- **Description:** A transformer-based value network that estimates the value of a given state sequence.
- **Classes and Methods:**
  - `__init__(...)`: Initializes the network layers.
  - `forward(src)`: Performs the forward pass to compute state value.
- **Example Usage:**
    ```python
    value_net = TransformerValueNetwork(input_dim=10)
    state_value = value_net(state_sequence)
    ```

### 3.3 TransformerRewardModel
- **Description:** A transformer-based reward model that assigns reward estimates to thought branches.
- **Classes and Methods:**
  - `__init__(...)`: Initializes the network layers.
  - `forward(src)`: Performs the forward pass to compute reward estimates.
- **Example Usage:**
    ```python
    reward_model = TransformerRewardModel(input_dim=10)
    reward_estimate = reward_model(reward_input)
    ```

### 3.4 ThoughtTree
- **Description:** Represents a tree structure of thoughts, where each node corresponds to a state and its associated reward.
- **Classes and Methods:**
  - `__init__(root_state)`: Initializes the thought tree with a root state.
  - `add_child(parent, child_state, reward)`: Adds a child node to the given parent node.
- **Example Usage:**
    ```python
    thought_tree = ThoughtTree(root_state)
    child = thought_tree.add_child(parent, child_state, reward)
    ```

### 3.5 monte_carlo_rollout
- **Description:** Simulates future thought sequences using the policy network to generate actions and predicts rewards.
- **Functions:**
  - `monte_carlo_rollout(policy_net, state_sequence, depth, max_depth, sequence_length)`: Performs the rollout.
- **Example Usage:**
    ```python
    rollout = monte_carlo_rollout(policy_net, current_sequence, 0, 5, 10)
    ```

### 3.6 train
- **Description:** Trains the policy and value networks using the PPO algorithm over multiple iterations and episodes.
- **Functions:**
  - `train(policy_net, value_net, reward_model, ...)`: Training routine.
- **Example Usage:**
    ```python
    train(policy_net, value_net, reward_model, num_iterations=1000, ...)
    ```
