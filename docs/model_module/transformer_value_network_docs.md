## 2. Detailed Responsibilities
- **Embedding:** Projects input state dimensions to a higher-dimensional space for transformer processing.
- **Transformer Encoding:** Utilizes transformer encoder layers to understand temporal and contextual information within the state sequence.
- **Value Output:** Applies a linear layer to produce a scalar value estimate representing the state's value.

## 3. Components
- **Classes:**
  - `TransformerValueNetwork`: Defines the network architecture and forward computation.
- **Methods:**
  - `__init__`: Sets up the network layers and parameters.
  - `forward`: Executes the forward pass to compute state value estimates.
