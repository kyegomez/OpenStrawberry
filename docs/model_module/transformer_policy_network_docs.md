# TransformerPolicyNetwork Documentation

## 1. Module Overview
- **Component Name:** TransformerPolicyNetwork
- **Purpose:** Generates action probabilities based on input state sequences using a transformer architecture.
- **Key Responsibilities:**
  - Embedding input state sequences.
  - Encoding sequences with transformer layers.
  - Outputting action probabilities for decision-making.

## 2. Detailed Responsibilities
- **Embedding:** Transforms input dimensions to a higher-dimensional space suitable for transformer processing.
- **Transformer Encoding:** Processes the embedded sequences to capture temporal dependencies and patterns.
- **Action Probability Output:** Applies a linear layer followed by a softmax function to produce probability distributions over possible actions.

## 3. Components
- **Classes:**
  - `TransformerPolicyNetwork`: Defines the network architecture and forward pass.
- **Methods:**
  - `__init__`: Initializes the network layers and parameters.
  - `forward`: Performs the forward propagation to compute action probabilities.

## 4. Data Model
Not applicable for this component.

## 5. API Specifications
Not applicable for this component.

## 6. Implementation Details
- **Technology Stack:** Implemented using PyTorch's `nn.Module`.
- **Architectural Patterns:** Utilizes transformer encoder layers for sequence modeling.
- **Integration Points:** Receives state sequences as input and provides action probabilities to the training loop.

## 7. Security Considerations
- **Data Handling:** Ensures that input data is properly sanitized before processing.

## 8. Performance & Scalability
- **Optimization:** Leverages PyTorch's optimized transformer layers for efficient computation.
- **Scalability:** Can handle varying sequence lengths and batch sizes as required.

## 9. Extensibility
- **Future Enhancements:** Possible integration of attention mechanisms or alternative embeddings.

## 10. Example Use Cases
```python
Initialize the policy network
policy_net = TransformerPolicyNetwork(input_dim=10, action_dim=4)
Forward pass with a sample input
state_sequence = torch.randn(10, 1, 10) # (sequence_length, batch_size, input_dim)
action_probs = policy_net(state_sequence)
print(action_probs)
```

## 11. Testing Strategies
- **Unit Tests:** Verify the correctness of the forward pass and output dimensions.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure compatibility with other components like the training loop.

## 12. Deployment Instructions
