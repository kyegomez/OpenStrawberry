# Monte Carlo Rollout Documentation

## 1. Module Overview
- **Component Name:** Monte Carlo Rollout
- **Purpose:** Simulates future state-action-reward trajectories to inform policy updates using the policy network.
- **Key Responsibilities:**
  - Generating action samples based on current policy.
  - Transitioning states based on sampled actions.
  - Calculating rewards for transitioned states.
  - Accumulating trajectories of states and rewards up to a specified depth.

## 2. Detailed Responsibilities
- **Action Sampling:** Utilizes the policy network to generate probabilistic actions for each state in the sequence.
- **State Transition:** Applies a state transition function to move from the current state to the next state based on actions.
- **Reward Calculation:** Computes rewards for each transitioned state using a predefined reward function.
- **Trajectory Accumulation:** Collects sequences of state-action-reward tuples to form trajectories used in training.

## 3. Components
- **Functions:**
  - `monte_carlo_rollout`: Executes the rollout process using the policy network to simulate future states and rewards.
  
## 4. Data Model
- **Input Parameters:**
  - `policy_net` (TransformerPolicyNetwork): The policy network used to sample actions.
  - `state_sequence` (torch.Tensor): The current sequence of states.
  - `depth` (int): The current depth within the thought tree.
  - `max_depth` (int): The maximum depth to simulate.
  - `sequence_length` (int): The maximum length of the state sequence.
- **Output:**
  - `trajectory` (List[Tuple[torch.Tensor, float]]): A list of state sequences and their corresponding rewards.

## 5. API Specifications
Not applicable for this component.

## 6. Implementation Details
- **Technology Stack:** Implemented using Python and PyTorch.
- **Architectural Patterns:** Sequential simulation of state transitions and reward calculations.
- **Integration Points:** Collaborates with the policy network and reward function to generate trajectories.

## 7. Security Considerations
- **Data Validation:** Ensures that inputs to the function are properly sanitized and of expected types.

## 8. Performance & Scalability
- **Optimization:** Efficiently handles cloning and concatenation of tensors to manage state sequences.
- **Scalability:** Capable of handling different sequence lengths and depths as required by training scenarios.

## 9. Extensibility
- **Future Enhancements:** Ability to incorporate more complex state transition and reward functions.

## 10. Example Use Cases
```python
Define sample inputs
policy_net = TransformerPolicyNetwork(input_dim=10, action_dim=4)
state_sequence = torch.zeros(10, 1, 10) # Initial state sequence
depth = 0
max_depth = 5
sequence_length = 10
Perform Monte Carlo rollout
trajectory = monte_carlo_rollout(
policy_net=policy_net,
state_sequence=state_sequence,
depth=depth,
max_depth=max_depth,
sequence_length=sequence_length
)
for seq, reward in trajectory:
print(f"Sequence: {seq}, Reward: {reward}")
```

## 11. Testing Strategies
- **Unit Tests:** Ensure that the rollout function correctly samples actions, transitions states, and calculates rewards.
- **Integration Tests:** Validate the interaction between the rollout function, policy network, and reward function within the training loop.

## 12. Deployment Instructions
- **Dependencies:** Requires PyTorch and access to the policy network and reward function.
- **Usage:** Called within the training loop to generate trajectories for each episode.

## 13. Visual Aids
- **Flowchart:** Illustrates the step-by-step process of the Monte Carlo rollout, from action sampling to reward accumulation.

## 14. Inter-Module Documentation
- **Dependencies:** Depends on the `TransformerPolicyNetwork` for action probabilities and the `reward_function` for reward calculations.
- **Interactions:** Outputs trajectories used for computing returns and advantages during training.

## 15. Glossary
- **Trajectory:** A sequence of state-action-reward tuples generated during the rollout.
- **Monte Carlo Rollout:** A simulation method to explore possible future states and their rewards based on the current policy.
