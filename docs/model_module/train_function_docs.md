# Train Function Documentation

## 1. Module Overview
- **Component Name:** Train Function
- **Purpose:** Trains the policy and value networks using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) by iteratively updating network parameters based on sampled trajectories.
- **Key Responsibilities:**
  - Initializing optimizers for policy and value networks.
  - Managing the training loop over multiple iterations and episodes.
  - Collecting and processing trajectories for policy and value updates.
  - Logging training progress and losses.

## 2. Detailed Responsibilities
- **Optimizer Initialization:** Sets up Adam optimizers with specified learning rates for both policy and value networks.
- **Training Loop:** Iterates over a defined number of iterations, managing episodes within each iteration.
- **Trajectory Collection:** Gathers state-action-reward sequences through Monte Carlo rollouts.
- **Policy Update:** Applies PPO to update the policy network based on advantages computed from trajectories.
- **Value Update:** Updates the value network to minimize the mean squared error between predicted values and returns.
- **Logging:** Records training progress, including iteration counts and loss values, using the Loguru logger.

## 3. Components
- **Functions:**
  - `train`: Orchestrates the training process for policy and value networks.
  
## 4. Data Model
- **Input Parameters:**
  - `policy_net` (TransformerPolicyNetwork): The policy network to be trained.
  - `value_net` (TransformerValueNetwork): The value network to be trained.
  - `reward_model` (TransformerRewardModel): The reward model used to assign rewards.
  - `num_iterations` (int): Number of training iterations.
  - `episodes_per_iteration` (int): Number of episodes per iteration.
  - `max_depth` (int): Maximum depth for Monte Carlo rollouts.
  - `sequence_length` (int): Maximum length of state sequences.
  - `gamma` (float): Discount factor for returns.
  - `clip_epsilon` (float): Clipping parameter for PPO.
  - `policy_lr` (float): Learning rate for the policy optimizer.
  - `value_lr` (float): Learning rate for the value optimizer.
- **Output:** None (trains the networks in-place).
